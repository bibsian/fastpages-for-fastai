I'm Andrew Bibian and this is my repository of notebooks for learning about Deep Learning. This
section of my [blog](https://bibsian.github.io) is inspired by [fast.ai](https://fast.ai); a group of
amazing researchers whose mission is to democratize Deep Learning. They do this through teaching
courses, putting out research, and developing high level libraries for practitioners. I feel
lucky to have received a 2020 diversity fellowship for their USF's Deep Learning Certificate Course.

I hope you find something here that expands your thinking.
